Alien Invasion README

This is my first portfolio project for Codecademy CS101.
This course didn't teach me everything in this project I also
used books and online help. The game uses fullscreen but I left
lines in main.py under the __init__ method for windowed mode. Waves will become
increasingly harder as each level is defeated.
There is currently a score and a highscore; I have not added to keep
highscore once program is terminated. The player has three lives, losing one
each time an alien reaches the player.

Controls:

Q - quit

Arrow left - moves left

Arrow right - moves right

Spacebar - Shoot
